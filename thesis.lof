As the SAW mechanically stretches and compresses the piezoelectric, it generates regions of alternating polarization, creating a travelling periodic potential.}}{4}{figure.caption.4}%

The electron wavefunction in a Thouless pump traverses a closed path on a torus in $t\textrm {-}k$ space, encircling an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian \cite {thouless_quantization_1983}.}}{15}{figure.caption.8}%
