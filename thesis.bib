The most important finding is enhanced conductivity at large q for filling factors v = l/tr, where n is an even integer. This effect persists to high temperatures, greater than those at which the FQHE is observed, with the enhanced conductivity proportional to q and the effect width in B field proportional to q. These results are consistent with a recent theory describing Fermi surface formation at even denominator V. In addition to these results, at small v near l/.5, we observe a complex P{\textasciitilde}Jo, q) which we have mapped out as a function of w. This conductivity mode is consistent with a wavevector independent pinning mode in the insulating phase.},

At low SAW power levels the current reveals oscillatory behaviour as a function of the gate voltage with maxima between the plateaux of quantized 1D conductance. At high SAW power levels, an acoustoelectric current was observed at gate voltages beyond pinch-off. In this region the current displays a step-like behaviour as a function of the gate voltage (or of the SAW power) with the magnitude corresponding to the transfer of one electron per SAW cycle. We interpret this as due to trapping of electrons in the moving SAW-induced potential minima with the number of electrons in each minimum being controlled by the electron–electron interactions. As the number of electrons is reduced, the classical Coulomb charging energy becomes the Mott–Hubbard gap between two electrons and ﬁnally the system becomes a sliding Mott insulator with one electron in each well.},

At high sound intensities, a formerly homogeneous two-dimensional electron system breaks up into well confined stripes surfing the wave. As a result, we observe a strong reduction of electronic sound attenuation. On the other hand, large momentum transfer between the electron system and the wave results in nonlinear acoustoelectric effects and acoustoelectric amplification. We describe our experimental findings in terms of a generalized theory of the acoustoelectric effect and discuss the importance for possible device applications.},

            We present calculations on the spontaneous emission rates of Si rectangular quantum wires grown in the \{100\} plane. The electron and holes states are calculated within an effective mass approximation model. For holes, the minimum of the one-dimensional sub-bands is at the Γ- point. For electrons, the six anisotropic valleys at the conduction band minimum of bulk Si are not equivalent in the quantum wires and so, the minima of the energy sub-bands depend on the growth direction of the wire. For some wire directions in the \{100\} plane, the minimum of the ground electron sub-band is at the Γ-point. The directional dependence of the electron states is reflected on the spontaneous emission of the quantum wires. Light emission from Si quantum wires of diameters of a few nanometers can have direct transition character in the visible range. Phonon assisted transitions are then also present, but their intensity is three orders of magnitude smaller than the intensity of direct transitions. In Si quantum wires with indirect band gap the intensity and the peak position of the phonon assisted transitions exhibit dependence on the wires direction.},

	abstract = {Objectives. Histomorphologic studies have provided evidence of prostate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA)-producing tissue in the female urethra. Some urine samples from women in a small series were positive for PSA, but no systematic investigation of this subject has been done to date.
Methods. In a prospective study, we analyzed whether PSA occurs in the urine of women and what factors induce detectable PSA levels. The urine samples of 217 women were analyzed (Hybritech-Tandem E-PSA) under standardized conditions. The impact of urine pH and volume was investigated, and the results were correlated with clinical data (age, residual urine, urinary tract infection and prior sexual intercourse within 48 hours).
Results. A positive PSA level greater than the detection limit of 0.1 ng/mL was found in 11\% of the analyzed samples; their mean value was 0.29 ng/mL. pH correction did not result in a signiﬁcant difference. The voiding volume had no inﬂuence on the PSA level. Among the cases of detectable PSA, women younger than 50 years of age (n ϭ 14) had a mean PSA of 0.34 ng/mL and those older than 50 years (n ϭ 9) a mean of 0.23 ng/mL. One of 9 women with and 22 of 208 women without residual urine volume had a detectable PSA level, as did 0 of 20 with and 23 of 197 women without urinary tract infection, and 3 of 7 with and 20 of 210 women without prior sexual intercourse within the previous 48 hours. None of the differences were signiﬁcant.
Conclusions. A urine PSA level was detected in 11\% of all women studied, with PSA values apparently age dependent. Any urine portion is suitable for analysis. No inﬂuence was determined for residual urine volume or urinary tract infection. Sexual intercourse may cause detectable PSA values, but the data of this study did not provide sufﬁcient evidence for this hypothesis. UROLOGY 57: 717–720, 2001. © 2001, Elsevier Science Inc.},

A new regime of quantized transport is observed at low RF powers where the surface acoustic wave amplitude is comparable to the quantum dot charging energy. In this regime resonant transport through the single-electron dot state occurs which we interpret as turnstile-like operation in which the traveling wave amplitude modulates the entrance and exit barriers of the quantum dot in a cyclic fashion at GHz frequencies. For high RF powers, where the amplitude of the surface acoustic wave is much larger than the quantum dot energies, the quantized acoustoelectric current transport shows behavior consistent with previously reported results. However, in this regime, the number of quantized current plateaus observed and the plateau widths are determined by the properties of the quantum dot, demonstrating that the microscopic detail of the potential landscape in the split gate channel has a profound influence on the quantized acoustoelectric current transport.},

A hypothesis is presented that relates these different styles of sound to the pitch of the saxophone mouthpiece when played in isolation. Speciﬁcally, playing a low pitch on the mouthpiece is hypothesized to create a sound more typical of jazz, while playing a high pitch on the mouthpiece is hypothesized to create a sound more typical of symphonic music. Experimental data and the nearest-neighbor method using the Itakura-Saito distortion provide statistically signiﬁcant evidence for the proposed hypothesis. The interaction between different mouthpieces and the mouthpiece pitch is also studied. This work has implications for scientists, musicians, and engineers.},

The local charge density increased abruptly whenever the Fermi level was swept through a van Hove singularity in the density of states, thereby coupling the cantilever’s mechanical oscillations to the nanotube’s local electronic properties. By using our technique to measure the local band gap of an intratube quantum-well structure, created by a nonuniform uniaxial strain, we have estimated the nanotube chiral angle. Our technique does not require attached electrodes or a specialized substrate, yielding a unique high-resolution spectroscopic tool that facilitates the comparison between local electronic structure of nanomaterials and further transport, optical, or sensing experiments.},

The determination of its value, which is closely linked to progress of the measurement techniques, started in the beginning of the twentieth century and is still on-going. Today, in the frame of the CODATA adjustment, the evaluation of the fundamental constant, e, is derived from a complex calculation and is no more related to a single experiment. But the development of single electron tunneling (SET) devices, started in the early 90s, has opened the path towards modern metrological systems as quantum current sources. Thus a new direct determination of e is possible by implementing an electron pump and the set-up of the quantum metrological triangle (QMT) in combination with the experiments linking mechanical and electrical units. Furthermore, we show how the QMT experiment can contribute to the establishment of a new system of units based on fundamental constants of physics.},

This AFM technique provides an alternative to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) when TEM imaging is not possible due to substrate thickness. We have used variable-force AFM to characterize horizontally aligned CNTs grown on ST-cut quartz. Our measurements reveal new aspects of horizontally aligned growth that are essential for enhancing the performance of CNT-based devices as well as understanding the growth mechanism. First, previously reported optimal growth conditions produce a large spread in CNT diameters and a signiﬁcant fraction of double-walled CNTs. Second, monodispersity is signiﬁcantly improved when growth temperature is reduced. Third, CNTs with diameters up to 5 nm align to the substrate, suggesting the interaction between CNTs and the quartz lattice is more robust than previously reported.},

              The superconducting dome—the appearance of a maximum in the transition temperature as a function of a tuning parameter—has been observed in compounds such as cuprates, pnictides, and heavy fermion materials and is thought of as a signature of unconventional superconductivity.

            Liquid gating tunes the carrier density in molybdenum disulfide, revealing unconventional superconductivity.
          , 
            
              A dome-shaped superconducting region appears in the phase diagrams of many unconventional superconductors. In doped band insulators, however, reaching optimal superconductivity by the fine-tuning of carriers has seldom been seen. We report the observation of a superconducting dome in the temperature–carrier density phase diagram of MoS
              2
              , an archetypal band insulator. By quasi-continuous electrostatic carrier doping achieved through a combination of liquid and solid gating, we revealed a large enhancement in the transition temperature

To clarify the dominant scattering mechanism, we perform extensive measurements on large-area samples with different mobility to exclude the edge effect. We analyze our data with the major scattering mechanisms such as short-range static scatters, short-range screened Coulomb disorders, and weak-localization (WL). We establish that the charged impurities are the predominant scatters because there is a strong correlation between the mobility and the charge impurity density. Near the charge neutral point (CNP), the electron-hole puddles that are induced by the charged impurities enhance the inter-valley scattering, which is favorable for WL observations. Away from the CNP, the charged-impurity-induced scattering is weak because of the effective screening by the charge carriers. As a result, the local static structural defects govern the charge transport. Our findings provide compelling evidence for understanding the scattering mechanisms in graphene and pave the way for the improvement of fabrication techniques to achieve high-quality CVD graphene.},

              Electrical contact to graphene is normally done with metal contacts on its flat face, where there are few strong bonding sites for the metal.
              
                Wang

              (p.

              ) encapsulated graphene with hexagonal boron nitride sheets and made metal contacts along its edge, where bonding orbitals are exposed. The resulting heterostructures had high electronic performance, with room-temperature carrier mobilities near the theoretical phonon-scattering limit.

            Metal contacts to graphene along its edge improve bonding and, in turn, electronic performance.
          , 
            Heterostructures based on layering of two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride represent a new class of electronic devices. Realizing this potential, however, depends critically on the ability to make high-quality electrical contact. Here, we report a contact geometry in which we metalize only the 1D edge of a 2D graphene layer. In addition to outperforming conventional surface contacts, the edge-contact geometry allows a complete separation of the layer assembly and contact metallization processes. In graphene heterostructures, this enables high electronic performance, including low-temperature ballistic transport over distances longer than 15 micrometers, and room-temperature mobility comparable to the theoretical phonon-scattering limit. The edge-contact geometry provides new design possibilities for multilayered structures of complimentary 2D materials.},

	abstract = {Correlated electron states in high mobility two-dimensional electron systems (2DESs), including charge density waves and microemulsion phases intermediate between a Fermi liquid and Wigner crystal, are predicted to exhibit complex local charge order. Existing experimental studies, however, have mainly probed these systems at micron to millimeter scales rather than directly mapping spatial organization. Scanning probes should be well-suited to study the spatial structure of these states, but high mobility 2DESs are found at buried semiconductor interfaces, beyond the reach of conventional scanning tunneling microscopy. Scanning techniques based on electrostatic coupling to the 2DES deliver important insights, but generally with resolution limited by the depth of the 2DES. In this letter, we present our progress in developing a technique called “virtual scanning tunneling microscopy” that allows local tunneling into a high mobility 2DES. Using a specially designed bilayer GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure where the tunnel coupling between two separate 2DESs is tunable via electrostatic gating, combined with a scanning gate, we show that the local tunneling can be controlled with sub-250 nm resolution.},

To date, deterministic transfer methods rely on the use of sacriﬁcial polymer layers and wet chemistry to some extent. Here, we develop an all-dry transfer method that relies on viscoelastic stamps and does not employ any wet chemistry step. This is found to be very advantageous to freely suspend these materials as there are no capillary forces involved in the process.

            We report ZnO/glass surface acoustic wave (SAW) humidity sensors with high sensitivity and fast response using graphene oxide sensing layer. The frequency shift of the sensors is exponentially correlated to the humidity change, induced mainly by mass loading effect rather than the complex impedance change of the sensing layer. The SAW sensors show high sensitivity at a broad humidity range from 0.5\%RH to 85\%RH with {\textless} 1 sec rise time. The simple design and excellent stability of our GO-based SAW humidity sensors, complemented with full humidity range measurement, highlights their potential in a wide range of applications.},

	abstract = {Typical applications of quantum light require optical sources which generate either individual photons or entangled (correlated) photons. For the sake of practicality and scalability, these quantum sources should be easily produced, operate at room temperature, and be electrically excited and controlled. Here, recent research on quantum sources obtained from electrically driven (ED) devices constructed from p–n junctions integrated in planar optical cavities, micropillars, nanowires, photonic crystals, and active plasmonic elements is reviewed. Single‐photon and entangled‐photon sources are distinguished by their different roles in the development of either quantum cryptography or quantum computing protocols, and the different types of devices used to produce them are highlighted, with a focus on their spectral emission, brightness, and conditions of operation. Achievements to date are summarized and compared with prerequisites for the practical use of these sources. Important recent results that could provide future novel quantum sources are also in focus, where more practical requirements could be addressed by the judicious engineering of materials and careful device design.},

Amplification of 33.2 dB/cm for the satellite +1, and of 13.8 dB/cm for the satellite +2, at 471 MHz has been observed where the external DC voltage of +10 V was applied. Amplification of SAW occurs above a DC field much smaller than that of a system using bulk semiconductor.

The measured acoustoelectric current increases with illumination, more than the measured change in the conductivity of the graphene, whilst retaining a linear dependence on the SAW intensity. The latter is consistent with the interaction between the carriers and SAWs being described by a relatively simple classical relaxation model suggesting that the change in the acoustoelectric current is caused by the effect of the illumination on the electronic properties of the graphene. The increase in the acoustoelectric current is greatest under illumination with the blue LED, consistent with the creation of a hot electron distribution.},

	abstract = {Introduction. During sexual stimulation, some women report the discharge of a noticeable amount of ﬂuid from the urethra, a phenomenon also called “squirting.” To date, both the nature and the origin of squirting remain controversial. In this investigation, we not only analyzed the biochemical nature of the emitted ﬂuid, but also explored the presence of any pelvic liquid collection that could result from sexual arousal and explain a massive ﬂuid emission.
Methods. Seven women, without gynecologic abnormalities and who reported recurrent and massive ﬂuid emission during sexual stimulation, underwent provoked sexual arousal. Pelvic ultrasound scans were performed after voluntary urination (US1), and during sexual stimulation just before (US2) and after (US3) squirting. Urea, creatinine, uric acid, and prostatic-speciﬁc antigen (PSA) concentrations were assessed in urinary samples before sexual stimulation (BSU) and after squirting (ASU), and squirting sample itself (S).
Results. In all participants, US1 conﬁrmed thorough bladder emptiness. After a variable time of sexual excitation, US2 (just before squirting) showed noticeable bladder ﬁlling, and US3 (just after squirting) demonstrated that the bladder had been emptied again. Biochemical analysis of BSU, S, and ASU showed comparable urea, creatinine, and uric acid concentrations in all participants. Yet, whereas PSA was not detected in BSU in six out of seven participants, this antigen was present in S and ASU in ﬁve out of seven participants.
Conclusions. The present data based on ultrasonographic bladder monitoring and biochemical analyses indicate that squirting is essentially the involuntary emission of urine during sexual activity, although a marginal contribution of prostatic secretions to the emitted ﬂuid often exists.

An optimized SAW design and a nanofabrication process flow were developed, which enabled superior device performance in terms of frequency, signal losses, and electromagnetic coupling. The influence of the device alignment on the substrate crystal planes, in addition to the IDT period and electrode design, is found to have a significant impact on various process metrics. As an example, two identical SAW transducers fabricated perpendicular to each other may have a resonant frequency difference approaching 1 GHz, for the same harmonic mode. These and other trends are presented and discussed.},

To preserve the pristine material properties, we have developed a ﬂip-chip setup where gates are separated from the material by a vacuum, which allows nanoscale electrostatic gating of the material without exposing it to invasive nanoprocessing. An additional beneﬁt is the vacuum between gates and material, which, unlike gate dielectrics, is free from charge traps. We demonstrate the operation and feasibility of the ﬂip-chip setup by achieving quantum interference at integer quantum Hall states in a Fabry−Peŕ ot interferometer based on a GaAs/AlGaAs 2DEG. Our results pave the way for the study of exotic phenomena including fragile fractional quantum Hall states by preserving the high quality of the material.},

	abstract = {An extensively pursued current direction of research in physics aims at the development of practical technologies that exploit the effects of quantum mechanics. As part of this ongoing effort, devices for quantum information processing, secure communication, and high-precision sensing are being implemented with diverse systems, ranging from photons, atoms, and spins to mesoscopic superconducting and nanomechanical structures. Their physical properties make some of these systems better suited than others for specific tasks; thus, photons are well suited for transmitting quantum information, weakly interacting spins can serve as long-lived quantum memories, and superconducting elements can rapidly process information encoded in their quantum states. A central goal of the envisaged quantum technologies is to develop devices that can simultaneously perform several of these tasks, namely, reliably store, process, and transmit quantum information. Hybrid quantum systems composed of different physical components with complementary functionalities may provide precisely such multitasking capabilities. This article reviews some of the driving theoretical ideas and first experimental realizations of hybrid quantum systems and the opportunities and challenges they present and offers a glance at the near- and long-term perspectives of this fascinating and rapidly expanding field.},

Individual atoms within clusters have underlying surface symmetry and can bind to different surface sites as clusters form.

            Clusters built from individual iron atoms adsorbed on surfaces (adatoms) were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) with subatomic resolution. Single copper and iron adatoms appeared as toroidal structures and multiatom clusters as connected structures, showing each individual atom as a torus. For single adatoms, the toroidal shape of the AFM image depends on the bonding symmetry of the adatom to the underlying structure [twofold for copper on copper(110) and threefold for iron on copper(111)]. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental data. The findings correct our previous work, in which multiple minima in the AFM signal were interpreted as a reflection of the orientation of a single front atom, and suggest that dual and triple minima in the force signal are caused by dimer and trimer tips, respectively.},

            Electrostatic gates are of paramount importance for the physics of devices based on high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) since they allow depletion of electrons in selected areas. This field-effect gating enables the fabrication of a wide range of devices such as, for example, quantum point contacts (QPC), electron interferometers and quantum dots. To fabricate these gates, processing is usually performed on the 2DEG material, which is in many cases detrimental to its electron mobility. Here we propose an alternative process which does not require any processing of the 2DEG material other than for the ohmic contacts. This approach relies on processing a separate wafer that is then mechanically mounted on the 2DEG material in a flip-chip fashion. This technique proved successful to fabricate quantum point contacts on both GaAs/AlGaAs materials with both moderate and ultra-high electron mobility.},

              Isolating large-areas of atomically thin transition metal chalcogenide crystals is an important but challenging task. The mechanical exfoliation technique can provide single layers of the highest structural quality, enabling to study their pristine properties and ultimate device performance.

That transport induces doping dependent macroscopic acoustoelectric current. The chemical doping can manipulate majority carriers and induces unique acoustoelectric features. The observation is explained by a classical relaxation model. Eventually the device based on acoustoelectric current is proved to outperform the common chemiresistor for chemicals. Our finding provides insight into acoustic charge carrier transport during chemical doping. The doping affects interaction of carriers with SAW phonon and facilitates the understanding of nanoscale acoustoelectric effect.

A promising approach is the generation of sp3 hybridized carbon atoms in the sp2-bonded lattice. We have investigated the possibility of using a carboxylic acid-functionalized diazonium reagent to introduce a deﬁned number of sp3 defects into electrically contacted CNTs. Having performed real-time measurements on individually contacted CNTs, we show that the formation of an individual defect is accompanied by an upward jump in resistance of approximately 6 kΩ. Additionally, we observe downward jumps in resistance of the same size, indicating that some defects are unstable. Our results are explained by a two-step reaction mechanism. Isolated aryl groups, formed in the ﬁrst step, are unstable and dissociate on the minute time scale. Stable defect generation requires a second step: the coupling of a second aryl group adjacent to the ﬁrst. Additional mechanistic understanding is provided by a systematic investigation of the gate voltage dependence of the reaction, showing that defect formation can be turned on and oﬀ. In summary, we demonstrate an unprecedented level of control over sp3 defect formation in electrically contacted CNTs, and prove that sp3 defects are minimally disruptive to the electrical performance of CNTs.},

The ability to dynamically control the properties of SAWs would allow the creation of devices with improved performance or new functionality. However, so far it has proved extremely difficult to develop a practical way of achieving this control. In this paper we demonstrate voltage control of SAWs in a hybrid graphene-lithium niobate device. The velocity shift of the SAWs was measured as the conductivity of the graphene was modulated using an ion-gel gate, with a 0.1\% velocity shift achieved for a bias of approximately 1 V. This velocity shift is comparable to that previously achieved in much more complicated hybrid semiconductor devices, and optimization of this approach could therefore lead to a practical, cost-effective voltage-controlled velocity shifter. In addition, the piezoelectric fields associated with the SAW can also be used to trap and transport the charge carriers within the graphene. Uniquely to graphene, we show that the acoustoelectric current in the same device can be reversed, and switched off, using the gate voltage.},

            Since their discovery, carbon nanotubes have fascinated many researchers due to their unprecedented properties. However, a major drawback in utilizing carbon nanotubes for practical applications is the difficulty in positioning or growing them at specific locations. Here we present a simple, rapid, non-invasive and scalable technique that enables optical imaging of carbon nanotubes. The carbon nanotube scaffold serves as a seed for nucleation and growth of small size, optically visible nanocrystals. After imaging the molecules can be removed completely, leaving the surface intact, and thus the carbon nanotube electrical and mechanical properties are preserved. The successful and robust optical imaging allowed us to develop a dedicated image processing algorithm through which we are able to demonstrate a fully automated circuit design resulting in field effect transistors and inverters. Moreover, we demonstrate that this imaging method allows not only to locate carbon nanotubes but also, as in the case of suspended ones, to study their dynamic mechanical motion.},

The Carnot bound is inapplicable to such a hybrid machine. Intriguingly, it may exhibit dual action, concurrently as engine and refrigerator, with up to 100\% efficiency.

                We have measured the differential conductance of a  parallel carbon nanotube (CNT) double quantum dot (DQD) with strong  inter‐dot capacitance and inter‐dot tunnel coupling. Nominally, the  device consists of a single CNT with two contacts. However, we  identify two sets of Coulomb blockade (CB) diamonds that do not  block transport individually, which suggest that two quantum dots  (QDs) are contacted in parallel. We find strong and periodic  anti‐crossings in the gate and bias dependence, which are only  possible if the QDs have similar characteristics. We discuss  qualitatively the level spectrum and the involved transport  processes in this device and extract the DQD coupling parameters.  These results lead us to believe that clean and undoped QDs are  formed parallel to the CNT axis, possibly on the outer and inner  shells of a multi‐wall CNT, or in a double‐stranded CNT bundle.},

	abstract = {In this paper we accurately revisit the mechanical exfoliation and layer number determination of MoS2. By modelling the exfoliation itself as a random vertical (lateral) exfoliation (fragmentation) phenomenon, a rationale is given to optimise the number of iterations in the scotch-tape peeling technique and we rigorously demonstrate that since the second cleavage the occurrence of monolayers is the most likely. For the unambiguous layer number identification, experiments have been carried out with a unified complementary approach based on optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, resonant and non resonant Raman spectroscopy, and photo-luminescence spectroscopy. The experimental analysis has been carried out on a statistically significant set of few-layer MoS2 flakes (from one to five layers). The work stresses the strong need of such complementary multitechnique approach to really unambiguously determine the layer number of flakes (that neither optical microscopy, nor AFM alone can give). Optical microscopy contrast analysis experiments (carried out on flakes deposited onto 270 nm SiO2/Si(1 0 0) substrates) demonstrate that for fewlayer MoS2 (from the mono to the epta-layer) the optical contrast is weakly depending on the radiation wavelength and is a non-monotonic function of the layer number. Thus, flakes from ten to twelve layers exhibit the same contrast of monolayers, as demonstrated by parallel AFM analysis. AFM clearly shows that the stacking between the silicon oxide substrate and the first MoS2 layer is strongly unpredictable and likely depending on the degree of surface contamination of the substrate. A parallel systematic resonant Raman study is performed ranging from one to five layers clearly exhibiting systematic layer dependent spectral features in the one-five layers range. For the first time a layer estimation number based on a quantitative analysis of resonant Raman and PL spectra is proposed.},

The device fabrication exploited a surface micromachining aluminum nitride process on a silicon wafer, facilitating an integration of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) delay line and a graphene field-effect transistor. The SAW device induced an AE current in graphene, which scales linearly with the input power and remains essentially constant when subtracting the offset current at different DC biases. At a constant DC bias, the AE current can be modulated by the gate voltage, due to the change of the carrier mobility in graphene. A four-fold enhancement in the AE current was realized when ∼35 V voltage was applied to the gate electrode. The highly integrated device proves to be a powerful tool to understand the AE current in graphene, and since it supports integration for versatile functionality, it opens an avenue to explore the properties of diverse nanomaterials.},

Acoustoelectric effects in graphene are induced by launching surface acoustic waves (SAWs) on a piezoelectric LiNbO3 substrate. We measure the acoustoelectric current Iae through graphene and extract the SAW attenuation factor Γ as a function of n. The magnitude of Iae increases with decreasing n when the n is far from the charge neutral point (CNP). When n is tuned across the CNP, Iae first exhibits a local maximum, vanishes at the CNP, and then changes sign in accordance with the associated change in the carrier polarity. By contrast, Γ monotonically increases with decreasing n and reaches a maximum at the CNP. The extracted values of Γ, calibrated at the central frequency of 189 MHz, vary from ∼0.4 m−1 to 6.8 m−1, much smaller than the values for known two-dimensional systems. Data analysis suggests that the evolution of Iae and Γ with n manifests the electronic states of graphene.

A Langmuir probe was used to investigate the electron energy distribution function, where the chamber pressure, power, and process duration were kept constant and the oxygen concentration was varied from 0 to 60 vol. \%. The results showed that in both the chambers, the atomic concentrations of oxygen and fluorine increased rapidly when the fraction of oxygen in the SF6 plasma was increased to 20 vol. \% and decreased with further addition of oxygen. Scanning electron microscopy showed an etch feature with a minimal lateral run-out at an O2 concentration of 20 vol. \% in both the chambers. The distribution of electron energy and the concentrations of oxygen and fluorine exhibited similar patterns as functions of the oxygen concentration in the SF6 plasma in the two chambers, but the values were different because of the different chamber geometries, which also affected the silicon etch rate and lateral run-out.},

              Photonic quantum information requires high-purity, easily accessible, and scalable single-photon sources. Here, we report an electrically driven single-photon source based on colloidal quantum dots. Our solution-processed devices consist of isolated CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots sparsely buried in an insulating layer that is sandwiched between electron-transport and hole-transport layers. The devices generate single photons with near-optimal antibunching at room temperature, i.e., with a second-order temporal correlation function at zero delay (

A quantitative model is developed to illustrate the carrier injection/recombination dynamics of single-dot electroluminescence.},

              Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising absorbers and emitters to enable novel photonic applications and devices but are also known to suffer from low optical quantum yields. Here we demonstrate SWCNT excitons coupled to plasmonic nanocavity arrays reaching deeply into the Purcell regime with Purcell factors (

              P
              ) up to

               = 57), Purcell-enhanced quantum yields of 62\% (average 42\%), and a photon emission rate of 15 MHz into the first lens. The cavity coupling is quasi-deterministic since the photophysical properties of every SWCNT are enhanced by at least one order of magnitude. Furthermore, the measured ultra-narrow exciton linewidth (18 μeV) reaches the radiative lifetime limit, which is promising towards generation of transform-limited single photons. To demonstrate utility beyond quantum light sources we show that nanocavity-coupled SWCNTs perform as single-molecule thermometers detecting plasmonically induced heat at cryogenic temperatures in a unique interplay of excitons, phonons, and plasmons at the nanoscale.},

            A gigahertz single-electron (SE) pump with a semiconductor charge island is promising for a future quantum current standard. However, high-accuracy current in the nanoampere regime is still difficult to achieve because the performance of SE pumps tends to degrade significantly at frequencies exceeding 1 GHz. Here, we demonstrate robust SE pumping via a single-trap level in silicon up to 7.4 GHz, at which the pumping current exceeds 1 nA. An accuracy test with an uncertainty of about one part per million (ppm) reveals that the pumping current deviates from the ideal value by only about 20 ppm at the flattest part of the current plateau. This value is two orders of magnitude better than the best one reported in the nanoampere regime. In addition, the pumping accuracy is almost unchanged up to 7.4 GHz, probably due to strong electron confinement in the trap. These results indicate that trap-mediated SE pumping is promising for achieving the practical operation of the quantum current standard.},

	abstract = {The photoluminescence (PL) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is dominated by the recombination of electrons in the conduction band with holes in the spin-orbit split valence bands, and there are two distinct emission features referred to as the A-peak (ground state exciton) and B-peak (higher spin-orbit split state). The intensity ratio of these two features varies widely, and several contradictory interpretations have been reported. In this work, we analyze the room temperature PL from MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 monolayers and identify the underlying cause of observed variations in emission profile. We determine that PL variations arise from differences in the non-radiative recombination associated with defect densities. Therefore, the relative intensities of the A- and B-emission features can be used to qualitatively assess the non-radiative recombination and a low B/A ratio is indicative of low defect density and high sample quality. We also performed polarization-resolved PL measurements. Emission from TMD monolayers is governed by unique optical selection rules which make them promising materials for valleytronic operations. We observe a notably higher valley polarization in the B-exciton relative to the A-exciton. The high polarization is a consequence of the shorter B-exciton lifetime resulting from rapid relaxation of excitons from the B-exciton to the A-exciton of the valence band. Our work clarifies disparities reported in the literature relating to the emission profile and provides a straightforward means to assess sample quality.},

We demonstrate that a surface acoustic wave (SAW) can be used to launch propagating SPPPs in graphene/h-BN heterostructures on a piezoelectric substrate like AlN, where the SAW-induced surface modulation acts as a dynamic diffraction grating. The efficiency of the light coupling is greatly enhanced by the introduction of the h-BN film as compared to the bare graphene/AlN system. The h-BN interlayer not only significantly changes the dispersion of the SPPPs but also enhances their lifetime. The strengthening of the SPPPs is shown to be related to both the higher carrier mobility induced in graphene and the coupling with h-BN and AlN surface phonons. In addition to surface phonons, hyperbolic phonons polaritons (HPPs) appear in the case of multilayer h-BN films leading to hybridized hyperbolic plasmon-phonon polaritons (HPPPs) that are also mediated by the SAW. These results pave the way for engineering ­SAW-based graphene/h-BN plasmonic devices and metamaterials covering the mid-IR to THz range.},

Conversely, the periodic electric and strain fields of the SAW can be used to modify the graphene Dirac cone and to couple light into graphene plasmons. Finally, SAWs can generate acousto-electric currents in graphene. These increase linearly with the SAW frequency and power but, in contrast to conventional currents, they depend non-monotonously on the graphene electric conductivity. Most of these functionalities have been reported in graphene transferred to the surface of strong piezoelectric insulators. The recent observation of acoustoelectric currents in epitaxial graphene on SiC opens the way to the large-scale fabrication of graphene-based acousto-electric devices patterned directly on a semi-insulating wafer.},

For all nanoribbon widths, the acoustoelectric current was observed to decrease on illumination, in contrast to the increase in acoustoelectric current measured in unpatterned graphene sheet devices. This is thought to be due to the higher initial conductivities of the nanoribbons compared to unpatterned devices.},

	abstract = {Atomically thin 2D materials span the common components of electronic circuits as metals, semiconductors, and insulators, and can manifest correlated phases such as superconductivity, charge density waves, and magnetism. An ongoing challenge in the ﬁeld is to incorporate these 2D materials into multilayer heterostructures with robust electrical contacts while preventing disorder and degradation. In particular, preserving and studying air-sensitive 2D materials has presented a signiﬁcant challenge since they readily oxidize under atmospheric conditions. We report a new technique for contacting 2D materials, in which metal via contacts are integrated into ﬂakes of insulating hexagonal boron nitride, and then placed onto the desired conducting 2D layer, avoiding direct lithographic patterning onto the 2D conductor. The metal contacts are planar with the bottom surface of the boron nitride and form robust contacts to multiple 2D materials. These structures protect air-sensitive 2D materials for months with no degradation in performance. This via contact technique will provide the capability to produce “atomic printed circuit boards” that can form the basis of more complex multilayer heterostructures.},

              Systems simultaneously exhibiting superconductivity and spin–orbit coupling are predicted to provide a route toward topological superconductivity and unconventional electron pairing, driving significant contemporary interest in these materials. Monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors in particular lack inversion symmetry, yielding an antisymmetric form of spin–orbit coupling that admits both spin-singlet and spin-triplet components of the superconducting wavefunction. Here, we present an experimental and theoretical study of two intrinsic TMD superconductors with large spin–orbit coupling in the atomic layer limit, metallic 2H-TaS

              and 2H-NbSe
              2
              . We investigate the superconducting properties as the material is reduced to monolayer thickness and show that high-field measurements point to the largest upper critical field thus reported for an intrinsic TMD superconductor. In few-layer samples, we find the enhancement of the upper critical field is sustained by the dominance of spin–orbit coupling over weak interlayer coupling, providing additional candidate systems for supporting unconventional superconducting states in two dimensions.},

            According to the second law, the efficiency of cyclic heat engines is limited by the Carnot bound that is attained by engines that operate between two thermal baths under the reversibility condition whereby the total entropy does not increase. Quantum engines operating between a thermal and a squeezed-thermal bath have been shown to surpass this bound. Yet, their maximum efficiency cannot be determined by the reversibility condition, which may yield an unachievable efficiency bound above unity. Here we identify the fraction of the exchanged energy between a quantum system and a bath that necessarily causes an entropy change and derive an inequality for this change. This inequality reveals an efficiency bound for quantum engines energised by a non-thermal bath. This bound does not imply reversibility, unless the two baths are thermal. It cannot be solely deduced from the laws of thermodynamics.},

The 2D TI–superconductor transition can be driven by applying a small gate voltage.

	abstract = {The possibility to tailor photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) using external factors such as strain, doping, and external environment is of signiﬁcant interest for optoelectronic applications. Strain in particular can be exploited as a means to continuously vary the band gap. Micrometer-scale strain gradients were proposed for creating “artiﬁcial atoms” that can utilize the so-called exciton funneling eﬀect and work, for example, as exciton condensers. Here we describe room-temperature PL emitters that naturally occur whenever monolayer TMDC is deposited on an atomically ﬂat substrate. These are hydrocarbon-ﬁlled bubbles, which provide predictable, localized PL from well-separated sub-micrometer areas. Their emission energy is determined by the built-in strain controlled only by the substrate material, such that both the maximum strain and the strain proﬁle are universal for all bubbles on a given substrate, i.e., independent of the bubble size. We show that for bubbles formed by monolayer MoS2, PL can be tuned between 1.72 and 1.81 eV by choosing bulk PtSe2, WS2, MoS2, or graphite as a substrate, and its intensity is strongly enhanced by the funneling eﬀect. Strong substrate-dependent quenching of the PL in areas of good contact between MoS2 and the substrate ensures localization of the luminescence to bubbles only; by employing optical reﬂectivity measurements we identify the mechanisms responsible for the quenching. Given the variety of available monolayer TMDCs and atomically ﬂat substrates and the ease of creating such bubbles, our ﬁndings open a venue for making and studying the discussed light-emitting “artiﬁcial atoms” that could be used in applications.},

By combining reactive ion etching, in situ Ar+ sputtering and annealing, we achieve a relatively low edge contact resistance, high mobility (up to ∼30 cm2 V−1 s−1) and high on-current density ({\textgreater}50 μA/μm at VDS = 3V), comparable to top contacts. Furthermore, the atomically smooth hBN environment also preserves the intrinsic MoS2 channel quality during fabrication, leading to a steep subthreshold swing of 116 mV/dec with a negligible hysteresis. Hence, edge contacts are highly promising for large-scale practical implementation of encapsulated heterostructure devices, especially those involving air sensitive materials, and can be arbitrarily narrow, which opens the door to further shrinkage of 2D device footprint.},

Here, we demonstrate unipolar n-type MoTe2 transistors with the highest performance to date, including high saturation current ({\textgreater}400 μA/μm at 80 K and {\textgreater}200 μA/μm at 300 K) and relatively low contact resistance (1.2 to 2 kΩ·μm from 80 to 300 K), achieved with Ag contacts and AlOx encapsulation. We also investigate other contact metals (Sc, Ti, Cr, Au, Ni, Pt), extracting their Schottky barrier heights using an analytic subthreshold model. High-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that interfacial metal-Te compounds dominate the contact resistance. Among the metals studied, Sc has the lowest work function but is the most reactive, which we counter by inserting monolayer hexagonal boron nitride between MoTe2 and Sc. These metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) contacts partly depin the metal Fermi level and lead to the smallest Schottky barrier for electron injection. Overall, this work improves our understanding of n-type contacts to 2D materials, an important advance for low-power electronics.},

CM is promising disruptive improvements in photovoltaic energy conversion and light detection technologies. Current state-of-the-art nanomaterials including quantum dots and carbon nanotubes have demonstrated CM, but are not satisfactory owing to high-energy-loss and inherent difficulties with carrier extraction.

              Covalent doping of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) can modify their optical properties, enabling applications as single-photon emitters and bio-imaging agents. We report here a simple, quick, and controllable method for preparing oxygen-doped SWCNTs with desirable emission spectra. Aqueous nanotube dispersions are treated at room temperature with NaClO (bleach) and then UV-irradiated for less than one minute to achieve optimized O-doping. The doping efficiency is controlled by varying surfactant concentration and type, NaClO concentration, and irradiation dose. Photochemical action spectra indicate that doping involves reaction of SWCNT sidewalls with oxygen atoms formed by photolysis of ClO

              Defects in conventional semiconductors substantially lower the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a key metric of optoelectronic performance that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as monolayer MoS
              2
              , often exhibit low PL QY for as-processed samples, which has typically been attributed to a large native defect density. We show that the PL QY of as-processed MoS

Surprisingly, neutral exciton recombination is entirely radiative even in the presence of a high native defect density. This finding enables TMDC monolayers for optoelectronic device applications as the stringent requirement of low defect density is eased.},

	abstract = {Lift-off" is a simple, easy method for making metallic patterns on a substrate, especially for metals such as platinum and nickel which are difficult to be etched by conventional methods that involve wet chemical or dry reactive ion etching. The mechanism of the toluene single-step lift-off process is defined. The toluene penetrates to some depth into the resist film during the soaking cycle, extracting residual casting solvent and low-molecular-weight resin species. The toluene is subsequently removed by a rinse cycle. The penetrated layer of resist develops at a slower rate than the underlying bulk resist, producing the lift-off structure. Variances in the structure of the photoresist lift-off image are the result of complex interactions among exposure, toluene soaking, development, and post-application baking conditions. Effects produced by these variables can be controlled by monitoring the linewidth, overhang, and height of the lift-off resist structure using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). So, the purpose of this paper is to provide the details of the lift-off process using toluene to create the patterns with the highest accuracy. After each test, cross section of the patterned dry film side wall is observed under a microscope to check if a profile is obtained.},

Unique to two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials, the control can be achieved by modifying the stacking order through rotation and translation between the layers. Here, we report the first observation of stacking dependent interlayer magnetism in the 2D magnetic semiconductor, chromium tribromide (CrBr3), enabled by the successful growth of its monolayer and bilayer through molecular beam epitaxy. Using in situ spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we directly correlated the atomic lattice structure with observed magnetic order. We demonstrated that while individual CrBr3 monolayer is ferromagnetic, the interlayer coupling in bilayer depends strongly on the stacking order and can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. Our observations provide direct experimental evidence for exploring the stacking dependent layered magnetism, and pave the way for manipulating 2D magnetism with unique layer twist angle control.},

In particular, the blue channel transmittance shows a large and monotonic thickness dependence, making it a very convenient probe of the flake thickness. The method proves to be robust given the small flake-to-flake variation and the insensitivity to doping changes of MoS2. We also tested the method for MoSe2, WS2 and WSe2.

We observed that in pristine MoS2 devices, with intrinsic electron doping, an exciton dominant regime with an exciton lifetime of 3 ns exists, when doped electrostatically with holes. Interestingly we observe a sharp decrease in exciton lifetime and population with an increase of the electron density by electrostatic doping, with a corresponding increase in negative trion population. With increased hole doping by a chemical method, the exciton lifetime decreases, but it remains almost constant with electrostatic carrier density tuning. This decrease in lifetime, compared to that of the pristine case, might be due to the exciton−exciton annihilation mechanism which is proposed to be existent in a high exciton density regime. Further hole doping by a chemical method leads to a transition to a positive trion dominated regime, in which the exciton lifetime decreases further due to nonradiative energy transfer to the positive trions. We observe a slight increase in exciton lifetime due to partial neutralization of positive trions at high electrostatic electron doping and a corresponding increase in the probability of excitons. We suggest that when calculating the lifetime of excitons, the exciton-to-trions formation and exciton− exciton annihilation mechanisms should be considered. These ﬁne-tunings of excitons in monolayer MoS2 can provide a platform for probing the excitonic physics and photonic applications.},

Using photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, we unambiguously assign the chiralities of nanotubes on boron nitride by tracking individual tubes before and after contact with boron nitride. Although hexagonal boron nitride has a low dielectric constant and is attached to only one side of the nanotubes, we observe that optical transition energies are redshifted as much as {\textasciitilde}50 meV from the air-suspended nanotubes. We also perform statistical measurements on more than 400 tubes, and the redshifts are found to be dependent on tube diameter.

Additionally, Rayleigh scattering spectroscopy is conducted to conﬁrm the obtained chirality.

Here, we detail a non-invasive gating approach for probing two-dimensional electron systems on intrinsic H-Si(111) surfaces using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) gating assembly. In this architecture, all harsh device fabrication is performed on a single SOI chip, ensuring that the H-Si(111) surface remains in pristine condition, or as close to the original manufactured intrinsic-Si wafer as possible. To achieve this, we intentionally keep our H-Si(111) surfaces free of any dopants or metals, which are instead placed on the adjacent SOI chip. All electrical components, including Ohmic contacts and accumulation and depletion gates, are housed in the SOI piece. The Ohmic contacts on the SOI piece are brought into physical and electrical contact with the pristine H-Si(111) piece after being van der Waals bonded at room temperature, while all gates on the SOI piece are separated from the H-Si(111) surface by vacuum. Architecture details, baseline operation tests, and 77 K device characterization measurements will be discussed, as well as the implications of going beyond H-Si(111) surfaces and using our device architecture to facilitate transport measurements on halogen-terminated Si surfaces.},

Based on the induced acousto-electric current, we characterize the frequency domains of the transducer from its ﬁrst to the third harmonic. We ﬁnd an oscillatory attenuation of the surface acoustic wave (SAW) velocity depending on the conductivity of the graphene layer. The acousto-electric current reveals an additional ﬁne structure that is absent in pure magneto-transport. In addition, we ﬁnd a shift between the acousto-electric longitudinal voltage and the velocity change of the SAW. We attribute this shift to the periodic strain ﬁeld from the propagating SAW that slightly modiﬁes the Dirac cone.},

A speciﬁcally designed proximity-effect-correction algorithm is applied to mitigate the proximity effect occurring in the electron-beam lithography process. The IDTs with a period of 160 nm and a ﬁnger width of 35 nm are achieved, enabling a frequency of \$30 GHz on lithium niobate based SAW devices. Both centrosymmetric type and axisymmetric type IDT structures are fabricated, and the results show that the centrosymmetric type tends to excite lower-order Rayleigh waves and the axisymmetric type tends to excite higher-order wave modes. A mass sensitivity of \$388.2 MHz Â mm2/lg is demonstrated, which is \$109 times larger than that of a conventional quartz crystal balance and \$50 times higher than a conventional SAW device with a wavelength of 4 lm.},

The layout of interdigital transducers (IDT) in SAW devices is in plane and the traditional methods of improving frequency for SAW devices are the increase of acoustic velocity and the reduction of wavelength. However, these methods have a limit due to the limited acoustic velocity and the photolithography limit. This work proposes a new way for the development of high frequency SAW devices by redesigning the layout of IDT in three dimensions (3D). The set of IDTs is split into two layers, i.e. the ground electrodes on one layer and the signal electrodes on the other layer. This 3D layout of IDTs dramatically narrows the horizontal gap between two adjacent electrodes, which can signiﬁcantly increase the frequency. The frequency and the electromechanical coupling factor (K 2) of the four structures of SAW devices with the 3D layout of IDTs were studied by the ﬁnite element method (FEM). The results show that the frequency can be doubled under the same critical resolution of lithography due to the shortening of wavelength, and the 3D layout of IDTs is available for SAW devices based on piezoelectric thin ﬁlm or piezoelectric single crystal. This work develops a new alternative to increase the working frequency of SAW devices.},

            The development of systems for the deterministic transfer of two-dimensional (2D) materials have undoubtedly contributed to great advancements in 2D materials research. In fact, they have made it possible to fabricate van der Waals heterostructures and 2D materials-based devices with complex architectures. Nonetheless, as far as we know, the number of existing papers providing enough details to reproduce these systems by other research groups is very scarce in the literature. Moreover, these systems typically require the use of expensive optical and mechanical components hampering their applicability in research groups with a low budget. Here, we demonstrate how a deterministic placement system for 2D materials, set up with full capabilities, can be implemented for under 900 € -- which can be easily implemented in labs and educational labs with low budgets.},

By running current through the microheater one can vary the temperature of the polymer and induce a controlled biaxial expansion of its surface. This controlled biaxial expansion can be transduced to biaxial strain to 2D materials, placed onto the polymer surface, which in turn induces a shift of the optical spectrum. Our thermal strain actuators can reach a maximum biaxial strain of 0.64\%, and they can be modulated at frequencies up to 8 Hz. The compact geometry of these actuators results in a negligible spatial drift of 0.03 μm/°C, which facilitates their integration in optical spectroscopy measurements. We illustrate the potential of this strain engineering platform to fabricate a strain-actuated optical modulator with single-layer MoS2.},

Here, we report a strategy for constructing vdW heterostructures through the interface engineering of the exfoliation substrate using a sub-5 nm polymeric film. Our construction method has two main features that distinguish it from existing techniques. First is the consistency of its exfoliation process in increasing the yield and in producing large ({\textgreater}10,000 μm

Here, we report a simple mechanical exfoliation method to produce large-scale and high-quality 2D semiconductors, by designing an atomically ﬂat Au-mesh ﬁlm as the peeling tape. Using our prefabricated mesh tape, the limited contact region (between the 2D crystal and Au) could provide enough adhesion to mechanically exfoliate uniform 2D monolayers, and the noncontact region (between the mesh holes and monolayers) ensures weak interaction to mechanically release the 2D monolayers on desired substrates. Together, we demonstrate a scalable method to dry exfoliate various 2D monolayer arrays onto diﬀerent substrates without involving any solutions or contaminations, representing the optimization between material yield, scalability, and quality. Furthermore, detailed optical and electrical characterizations are conducted to conﬁrm their intrinsic quality. With the ability to mechanically exfoliate various 2D arrays and further restacking them, we have demonstrated large-scale van der Waals heterostructure arrays through layer-to-layer assembling. Our study oﬀers a simple and scalable method for dry exfoliating 2D monolayer and heterostructure arrays with intrinsic material quality, which could be crucial to accelerate fundamental investigations as well as practical applications of proof-of-concepts devices.},

	abstract = {Research in van der Waals heterostructures has been rapidly progressing in the past decade, thanks to the art of sequential and deterministic placement of one two-dimensional (2D) material over another. The successful creation of heterostructures however has relied largely on expensive transfer systems that are not easily accessible to researchers. Although a few reports on low-cost systems have recently surfaced, the full functionality, portability features, and overall eﬀectiveness of such systems are still being explored. In this work, we present an “all-inone” low-cost transfer setup that is compact, lightweight, and portable and which can be quickly installed with a facile and do it yourself (DIY)-style anaerobic glovebox option that performs at par with commercial anaerobic systems. The “installable” glovebox option means the user has the convenience of quickly converting the working environment into an inert one when air-sensitive 2D materials are used. The lowest RH values obtained in our glovebox is {\textless}3\%, and the O2 levels rapidly drop from 21\% to less than 0.1\% in just a few minutes of purging the chamber with inert gas. The transfer system is also equipped with a light-weight PID-controlled substrate heating option that can be easily assembled within just a few hours. We test the versatility of our low-cost system by the successful creation of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)-encapsulated graphene and hBN-encapsulated molybdenum disulphide (MoS2) heterostructures using the hot pickup technique and graphene-hBN, MoS2-hBN, twisted MoS2, and twisted MoS2 on hBN stacks using the wetting technique, and a MoS2-hBN-graphene vertical tunneling heterostructure was formed using a combination approach. The eﬀectiveness of the DIY glovebox is proven with the demonstration of extended stability of freshly exfoliated black phosphorous (BP) ﬂakes, their encapsulation between thin hBN layers, and the formation of electrically contacted BP devices with a protective hBN top layer. At an overall price point of approximately 1000 \$, the versatile setup presented here is expected to further contribute to the growth of research in 2D materials, in particular, for researchers initially faced with overcoming a huge entry-level threshold to work in the ﬁeld of 2D materials and van der Waals heterostructures.},

            This paper provides a pedagogical introduction to recent developments in geometrical and topological band theory following the discovery of graphene and topological insulators. Amusingly, many of these developments have a connection to contributions in high-energy physics by Dirac. The review starts by a presentation of the Dirac magnetic monopole, goes on with the Berry phase in a two-level system and the geometrical/topological band theory for Bloch electrons in crystals. Next, specific examples of tight-binding models giving rise to lattice versions of the Dirac equation in various space dimension are presented: in 1D (Su–Schrieffer–Heeger (SSH) and Rice–Mele models), 2D (graphene, boron nitride, Haldane model) and 3D (Weyl semi-metals). The focus is on topological insulators and topological semi-metals. The latter have a Fermi surface that is characterized as a topological defect. For topological insulators, the two alternative view points of twisted fiber bundles and of topological textures are developed. The minimal mathematical background in topology (essentially on homotopy groups and fiber bundles) is provided when needed. Topics rarely reviewed include: periodic versus canonical Bloch Hamiltonian (basis I/II issue), Zak versus Berry phase, the vanishing electric polarization of the SSH model and Dirac insulators.},

The large in-plane critical magnetic ﬁeld of this supercurrent is an indication that even inside the carbon nanotube Cooper pairs enjoy a degree of paramagnetic protection typical of the parent Ising superconductor. As expected for superconductors of nanoscopic cross section, the currentinduced breakdown of superconductivity is characterized by resistance steps due to the nucleation of phase slip centers.

In addition, we ﬁnd MoS2 regions that are strongly coupled to the superconductor, resulting in resonant Andreev tunneling and junction-dependent gap characteristics, suggesting a superconducting proximity eﬀect. Magnetoresistance measurements show that the bandstructure and the high intrinsic carrier mobility remain intact in the bulk of the MoS2.

	abstract = {Advisor: Ph. D. Alberto Ronzani Solid state coolers based on superconducting tunnel junctions are promising lowtemperature cooling devices which are routinely fabricated using modern microfabrication methods. Arising applications from quantum technologies often depend on subKelvin temperature to operate, requiring the use of bulky and expensive dilution refrigerators. Solid state coolers can potentially replace dilution refrigerators by cascading several microcoolers operating in diﬀerent temperature ranges. In order to achieve this, coolers have to be packed eﬃciently, thus 3D integration is essential. In this thesis, vertical integration of superconducting solid state coolers is studied and developed. Flip-chip bonding is utilized to interconnect two microchips together. Samples are studied before and after bonding, and the thermal resistance of 3D integrated device is determined. Quality assurance of the process focuses on indium bumps and isolation etching of adjacent islands in the cooler device. Cooling is not observed in the device, as the ﬂaws in the isolation etching limit the full capability of the device. However, thermal response of a device is studied, ﬁnding that the thermal resistance is signiﬁcantly improved compared to previous work.},

The GO/PDEA/AuNR/PATP-SAW sensor recorded a considerable negative frequency shift (−70.67 kHz) in detecting 80 ppm TNT at 25 °C/20 RH \%, thus enabling the detection of 40 ppb to 80 ppm TNT with the limit of detection as low as 40 ppb (−3.02 kHz). Short response/recovery time (40 ppb: 6.2/11.8 s) with good cycling stability and selectivity were achieved. The high performance of the GO/PDEA/AuNR/PATP-SAW sensor is attributed to its large specific surface area, roughness, and porosity. The oxygen-containing and electron-rich amino groups of the GO/PDEA/AuNR/ PATP provide many active sites for adsorbing TNT gas. The primary sensing mechanism is the mass and electrical load of the nanocomposite in TNT gas. It has an optimum thickness of 380 nm and room temperature as the optimum operating temperature. Therefore, this study would serve as a good basis for the research and development of next-generation acoustic gas-phase explosive sensors.},

These observations appear not to be compatible with a description in terms of conventional band transport of a 2D doped semiconductor. The observed phenomenology—and unambiguous signatures of a 1D van Hove singularity detected in energy‐resolved photocurrent measurements—indicate that electronic transport through CrSBr multilayers is better interpreted by considering the system as formed by weakly and incoherently coupled 1D wires, than by conventional 2D band transport. It is concluded that CrSBr is the first 2D semiconductor to show distinctly quasi‐1D electronic transport properties.},

            Surface acoustic wave (SAW)–matter interaction provides a fascinating key for inducing and manipulating novel phenomena and functionalities in two-dimensional (2D) materials. The dynamic strain field and piezo-electric field associated with propagating SAWs determine the coherent manipulation and transduction between 2D excitons and phonons. Over the past decade, many intriguing acoustic-induced effects, including the acousto-electric effect, acousto-galvanic effect, acoustic Stark effect, acoustic Hall effect and acoustic exciton transport, have been reported experimentally. However, many more phenomena, such as the valley acousto-electric effect, valley acousto-electric Hall effect and acoustic spin Hall effect, were only theoretically proposed, the experimental verification of which are yet to be achieved. In this minireview, we attempt to overview the recent breakthrough of SAW-induced phenomena covering acoustic charge transport, acoustic exciton transport and modulation, and coherent acoustic phonons. Perspectives on the opportunities of the proposed SAW-induced phenomena, as well as open experimental challenges, are also discussed, attempting to offer some guidelines for experimentalists and theorists to explore the desired exotic properties and boost practical applications of 2D materials.},

On the theoretical side, studies on phonon ampliﬁcation/attenuation and acoustoelectric current at low temperatures in graphene have reported approximate analytical results under exceedingly simplifying conditions using the Boltzmann transport equation. Overcoming the earlier simplifying assumptions, we investigate both numerically and analytically the governing kinetic equations for ampliﬁcation/attenuation and acoustoelectric current, taking into account the piezoelectric and deformation potential electron phonon coupling mechanism in the semi classical Boltzmann transport formalism approach, and obtain analytical results that are in reasonable agreement with the reported experimental results.},

              2D materials are considered as potential candidates for the next generation of optoelectronic materials. However, their optical absorption is typically weak due to thickness limitations, greatly restricting the photodetection capabilities of devices. To enhance the photoelectric gain of 2D materials or devices and improve detection sensitivity, various modulation methods such as strain, electric field, and magnetic field are commonly introduced. Among them, surface acoustic wave (SAW) represents a unique and effective modulation approach. In this study, photodetectors are fabricated based on few‐layer MoS

Under the influence of SAW, the dark current of the devices is significantly reduced by more than two orders of magnitude, while the photocurrent remains almost unchanged, resulting in excellent photoresponse performance. The devices provide a promising pathway for high‐performance optoelectronic applications and reveal a new possibility for acoustic devices in optoelectronics.},

However, the use of two-dimensional materials as active elements has shown promising results addressing these hurdles due to their remarkable sensitivity at room temperature. Since the revolutionary discovery of graphene and the synthesis or exfoliation of a myriad of nanosheets, these have been integrated into high performance gas sensors for e-noses. In this review, we highlight the signiﬁcant advancements and technologies in developing these devices, including the transduction mechanisms used to translate gas adsorption events into measurable signals and the methods for depositing 2D materials as part of the transducers. To overcome the issue of selectivity that often imposes a limitation to nanomaterial-based gas sensors, we discuss the potential of implementing artiﬁcial intelligence tools as the brain behind the sensor for smart data analysis.},

This technique has been used to discover emergent length scales in the fractional quantum Hall regime of traditional, semiconductor-based heterostructures. SAWs would appear to be an ideal match for van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, but the right combination of substrate and experimental geometry to allow access to the quantum transport regime has not yet been found. We demonstrate that SAW resonant cavities fabricated on LiNbO\$\_3\$ substrates can be used to access the quantum Hall regime of high-mobility, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulated graphene heterostructures. Our work establishes SAW resonant cavities as a viable platform for performing contactless conductivity measurements in the quantum transport regime of vdW materials.},

We demonstrate the CM effect through simple photocurrent measurements by fabricating the dual-gate p-n junction of a MoTe2 film on a transparent substrate. Electrons and holes were efficiently extracted by eliminating the Schottky barriers in the metal contact and minimizing multiple reflections. The photocurrent was elevated proportionately to the excitation energy. The boosted quantum efficiency confirms the multiple electron-hole pair generation of {\textgreater} 2Eg, consistent with CM results from an optical approach, pushing the solar cell efficiency beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit.},

	abstract = {Reactive ion etching of silicon in an RF parallel plate system, using SF6/O2/CHF3, plasmas has been studied. Etching behavior was found to be a function of loading, the cathode material, and the mask material. Good results with respect to reproducibility and uniformity have been obtained by using silicon as the cathode material and silicon dioxide as the masking material for mask designs where most of the surface is etched. Etch rate, selectivity, anisotropy, and self-bias voltage have been examined as a function of SF6 flow, 02 flow, CHF3 flow, pressure, and the RF power, using response surface methodology, in order to optimize anisotropic etching conditions. The effects of the variables on the measured responses are discussed. The anisotropic etch mechanism is based on ion-enhanced inhibitor etching. SF6 provides the reactive neutral etching species, 02 supplies the inhibitor film forming species, and SF6 and CHF3 generate ion species that suppress the formation of the inhibitor film at horizontal surfaces. Anisotropic etching of high aspect ratio structures with smooth etch surfaces has been achieved. The technique is applied to the fabrication of three-dimensional micromechanieal structures.},

              Defects in conventional semiconductors substantially lower the photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY), a key metric of optoelectronic performance that directly dictates the maximum device efficiency. Two-dimensional transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), such as monolayer MoS
              2
              , often exhibit low PL QY for as-processed samples, which has typically been attributed to a large native defect density. We show that the PL QY of as-processed MoS

              and WS
              2
              monolayers reaches near-unity when they are made intrinsic through electrostatic doping, without any chemical passivation. Surprisingly, neutral exciton recombination is entirely radiative even in the presence of a high native defect density. This finding enables TMDC monolayers for optoelectronic device applications as the stringent requirement of low defect density is eased.},

	doi = {10.1063/1.5053699},
	abstract = {The photoluminescence (PL) in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is dominated by the recombination of electrons in the conduction band with holes in the spin-orbit split valence bands, and there are two distinct emission features referred to as the A-peak (ground state exciton) and B-peak (higher spin-orbit split state). The intensity ratio of these two features varies widely, and several contradictory interpretations have been reported. In this work, we analyze the room temperature PL from MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2 monolayers and identify the underlying cause of observed variations in emission profile. We determine that PL variations arise from differences in the non-radiative recombination associated with defect densities. Therefore, the relative intensities of the A- and B-emission features can be used to qualitatively assess the non-radiative recombination and a low B/A ratio is indicative of low defect density and high sample quality. We also performed polarization-resolved PL measurements. Emission from TMD monolayers is governed by unique optical selection rules which make them promising materials for valleytronic operations. We observe a notably higher valley polarization in the B-exciton relative to the A-exciton. The high polarization is a consequence of the shorter B-exciton lifetime resulting from rapid relaxation of excitons from the B-exciton to the A-exciton of the valence band. Our work clarifies disparities reported in the literature relating to the emission profile and provides a straightforward means to assess sample quality.},

Acoustic radio frequency filters, for instance, are integral parts of wireless devices. SAWs in particular find applications in life sciences and microfluidics for sensing and mixing of tiny amounts of liquids. In addition to this continuously growing number of applications, SAWs are ideally suited to probe and control elementary excitations in condensed matter at the limit of single quantum excitations. Even collective excitations, classical or quantum are nowadays coherently interfaced by SAWs. This wide, highly diverse, interdisciplinary and continuously expanding spectrum literally unites advanced sensing and manipulation applications. Remarkably, SAW technology is inherently multiscale and spans from single atomic or nanoscopic units up even to the millimeter scale. The aim of this Roadmap is to present a snapshot of the present state of surface acoustic wave science and technology in 2019 and provide an opinion on the challenges and opportunities that the future holds from a group of renown experts, covering the interdisciplinary key areas, ranging from fundamental quantum effects to practical applications of acoustic devices in life science.},

When the crystal is also semiconducting, these fields produce currents and space charge resulting in acoustic dispersion and loss. A linear theory of this effect is developed, taking into account drift, diffusion, and trapping of carriers for both extrinsic and intrinsic semiconductors. Conductivity modulation sets an upper limit on strain amplitude for a linear theory. The directional characteristics and the magnitude of the effects are illustrated for CdS and GaAs.

              Excitons are elementary optical excitation in semiconductors. The ability to manipulate and transport these quasiparticles would enable excitonic circuits and devices for quantum photonic technologies. Recently, interlayer excitons in 2D semiconductors have emerged as a promising candidate for engineering excitonic devices due to their long lifetime, large exciton binding energy, and gate tunability. However, the charge-neutral nature of the excitons leads to weak response to the in-plane electric field and thus inhibits transport beyond the diffusion length. Here, we demonstrate the directional transport of interlayer excitons in bilayer WSe
              2
              driven by the propagating potential traps induced by surface acoustic waves (SAW). We show that at 100 K, the SAW-driven excitonic transport is activated above a threshold acoustic power and reaches 20 μm, a distance at least ten times longer than the diffusion length and only limited by the device size. Temperature-dependent measurement reveals the transition from the diffusion-limited regime at low temperature to the acoustic field-driven regime at elevated temperature. Our work shows that acoustic waves are an effective, contact-free means to control exciton dynamics and transport, promising for realizing 2D materials-based excitonic devices such as exciton transistors, switches, and transducers up to room temperature.},

Although suspending the graphene above the substrate leads to a substantial improvement in device quality13,14, this geometry imposes severe limitations on device architecture and functionality. There is a growing need, therefore, to identify dielectrics that allow a substrate-supported geometry while retaining the quality achieved with a suspended sample. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) is an appealing substrate, because it has an atomically smooth surface that is relatively free of dangling bonds and charge traps. It also has a lattice constant similar to that of graphite, and has large optical phonon modes and a large electrical bandgap. Here we report the fabrication and characterization of high-quality exfoliated mono- and bilayer graphene devices on single-crystal h-BN substrates, by using a mechanical transfer process. Graphene devices on h-BN substrates have mobilities and carrier inhomogeneities that are almost an order of magnitude better than devices on SiO2. These devices also show reduced roughness, intrinsic doping and chemical reactivity. The ability to assemble crystalline layered materials in a controlled way permits the fabrication of graphene devices on other promising dielectrics15 and allows for the realization of more complex graphene heterostructures.},

              Under the influence of an external magnetic field, the energies of electrons in two-dimensional systems group into the so-called Landau levels. In the cleanest samples, interactions among electrons lead to fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states. If such a system is then subjected to a superlattice potential, it is unclear whether the fragile FQH states will survive. To address this question, Wang
              et al.
              sandwiched graphene between two layers of hexagonal boron nitride. Transport measurements on the superlattice showed that some FQH states did survive. Furthermore, the interplay between interactions and the superlattice potential produced additional, anomalous states.

            The Hofstadter energy spectrum provides a uniquely tunable system to study emergent topological order in the regime of strong interactions. Previous experiments, however, have been limited to low Bloch band fillings where only the Landau level index plays a role. We report measurements of high-mobility graphene superlattices where the complete unit cell of the Hofstadter spectrum is accessible. We observed coexistence of conventional fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) states together with the integer QHE states associated with the fractal Hofstadter spectrum. At large magnetic field, we observed signatures of another series of states, which appeared at fractional Bloch filling index. These fractional Bloch band QHE states are not anticipated by existing theoretical pictures and point toward a distinct type of many-body state.},

	abstract = {The discovery of graphene in 2004 has sparked immense interest in atomically thin twodimensional (2D) materials as well as the heterostructures made by vertically assembling different 2D layers, called van der Waals heterostructures. These van der Waals heterostructures facilitate an incredible level of control in an experimental setting by allowing the atomic species of each layer to be selected down to individual atoms. Additionally, new tuning parameters in van der Waals heterostructures, such as the relative twist angle, facilitate the development of long-range interference patterns known as moiré patterns. These moiré patterns can give rise to long range interactions and complicated electronic superstructures. For example, correlated states and superconductivity have been discovered in bilayers of graphene when the twist angle is tuned to specific “magic angles” such that flat bands emerge in the moiré pattern Brillouin zone. In addition to moiré patterns, interlayer interactions and proximity effects between the layers of van der Waals heterostructure provide a useful platform for manifesting novel physical phenomena and exciting application potential. In this work, I explore numerous aspects of van der Waal heterostructures, primarily through scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, and develop a novel sample fabrication technique that facilitates the surface probe studies of air-sensitive 2D van der Waals heterostructures.},

              Integrating two-dimensional (2D) materials into semiconductor manufacturing lines is essential to exploit their material properties in a wide range of application areas.

Here, we report a generic methodology for large-area integration of 2D materials by adhesive wafer bonding. Our approach avoids manual handling and uses equipment, processes, and materials that are readily available in large-scale semiconductor manufacturing lines.

              The most recognizable feature of graphene’s electronic spectrum is its Dirac point, around which interesting phenomena tend to cluster. At low temperatures, the intrinsic behaviour in this regime is often obscured by charge inhomogeneity
              1,2
              but thermal excitations can overcome the disorder at elevated temperatures and create an electron–hole plasma of Dirac fermions. The Dirac plasma has been found to exhibit unusual properties, including quantum-critical scattering
              3–5
              and hydrodynamic flow
              6–8
              . However, little is known about the plasma’s behaviour in magnetic fields. Here we report magnetotransport in this quantum-critical regime. In low fields, the plasma exhibits giant parabolic magnetoresistivity reaching more than 100 per cent in a magnetic field of 0.1 tesla at room temperature. This is orders-of-magnitude higher than magnetoresistivity found in any other system at such temperatures. We show that this behaviour is unique to monolayer graphene, being underpinned by its massless spectrum and ultrahigh mobility, despite frequent (Planckian limit) scattering
              3–5,9–14
              . With the onset of Landau quantization in a magnetic field of a few tesla, where the electron–hole plasma resides entirely on the zeroth Landau level, giant linear magnetoresistivity emerges. It is nearly independent of temperature and can be suppressed by proximity screening
              15
              , indicating a many-body origin. Clear parallels with magnetotransport in strange metals
              12–14

	abstract = {We have combined a graphene ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor (GFET) and a surface acoustic wave (SAW) sensor on a LiTaO3 substrate to create a graphene surface acoustic wave (GSAW) sensor. When a SAW propagates in graphene, an acoustoelectric current (IA) ﬂows between two attached electrodes. This current has unique electrical characteristics, having both positive and negative peak values with respect to the electrolyte-gate voltage (VEg) in solution. We found that IA is controlled by VEg and the amplitude of the SAW. It was also conﬁrmed that the GSAW sensor detects changes of electrical charge in solution like conventional GFET sensors. Furthermore, the detection of amino-group-modiﬁed microbeads was performed by employing a GSAW sensor in a phthalate buﬀer solution at pH 4.1. The hole current peak shifted to the lower left in the IA−VEg characteristics. The left shift was caused by charge detection by the GFET and can be explained by an increase of amino groups that have positive charges at pH 4.1. In contrast, the downward shift is thought to be due to a reduction in the amplitude of the propagating SAW because of an increase in the mass loading of microbeads. This mass loading was detected by the SAW sensor. Thus, we have demonstrated that the GSAW sensor is a transducer capable of the simultaneous detection of charge and mass, which indicates that it is an attractive platform for highly sensitive and multifunctional solution sensing.},

	abstract = {We report on the response to the ambient air humidity of a surface acoustic wave (SAW) in YZ LiNbO3 substrate with the 200 nm-thick multi-layer graphene sheets deposited by chemical reduction from graphene oxide. With increasing relative humidity (RH), the SAW velocity decreases and the SAW attenuation increases. At humidity values below 60-65\%, the SAW velocity linearly depends on RH with the slope proportional to the SAW frequency. This is attributed to mass loading of the SAW propagation surface due to moisture adsorption by the graphene layer. The normalized fractional change in SAW velocity is 4.23∙10-2 ppm/(MHz∙\%RH). At higher humidity values, the velocity decrease becomes super-linear due to the change in elastic graphene properties. An exponential growth of the humidity-induced SAW attenuation by the graphene film with frequency (from 1 dB/cm at 57 MHz to 7 dB/cm at 286 MHz) has been observed. The time response to abrupt humidity changes is different for the transmitted SAW phase velocity and attenuation pointing out to different physical mechanisms responsible for humidity-induced SAW attenuation and velocity variations.},

We grow CVD graphene with grain sizes up to 250 μm to abate grain boundaries, and we transfer graphene utilizing a novel, dry-transfer method to minimize chemical contamination. We fabricate devices on both silicon dioxide and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) dielectrics to probe the eﬀects of substrate-induced disorder. On both substrate types, the large-grain CVD graphene samples are comparable in quality to the best reported exfoliated samples, as determined by low-temperature electrical transport and magnetotransport measurements. Small-grain samples exhibit much greater variation in quality and inferior performance by multiple measures, even in samples exhibiting high ﬁeld-eﬀect mobility.

In contrast, encapsulation with atomically ﬂat layered oxides such as mica, bismuth strontium calcium copper oxide, and vanadium pentoxide results in exceptionally low quality of graphene devices with mobilities of ∼1000 cm2 V−1 s−1. We attribute the diﬀerence mainly to self-cleansing that takes place at interfaces between graphene, hBN, and transition metal dichalcogenides. Surface contamination assembles into large pockets allowing the rest of the interface to become atomically clean. The cleansing process does not occur for graphene on atomically ﬂat oxide substrates.},

            The assembly of individual two-dimensional materials into van der Waals heterostructures enables the construction of layered three-dimensional materials with desirable electronic and optical properties. A core problem in the fabrication of these structures is the formation of clean interfaces between the individual two-dimensional materials which would affect device performance. We present here a technique for the rapid batch fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures, demonstrated by the controlled production of 22 mono-, bi- and trilayer graphene stacks encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride with close to 100\% yield. For the monolayer devices, we found semiclassical mean-free paths up to 0.9 μm, with the narrowest samples showing clear indications of the transport being affected by boundary scattering. The presented method readily lends itself to fabrication of van der Waals heterostructures in both ambient and controlled atmospheres, while the ability to assemble pre-patterned layers paves the way for complex three-dimensional architectures.},

The integration of 2D materials with existing technologies such as photonic and superconducting waveguides and fiber optics is another exciting possibility.

              Solid-state magnetic field sensors are important for applications in commercial electronics and fundamental materials research. Most magnetic field sensors function in a limited range of temperature and magnetic field, but Hall sensors in principle operate over a broad range of these conditions. Here, we evaluate ultraclean graphene as a material platform for high-performance Hall sensors.

For their realization, the optimal combination of substrate, graphene preparation, and insulator deposition and composition is required. This optimization must be based on an in-depth characterization of the obtained graphene insulator metal (GIM) stack. Hall effect measurements are frequently employed to study such systems, thereby focussing primarily on the charge carrier mobility. In this work we show how an analysis of the sheet Hall coefﬁcient can reveal further important properties of the GIM stack, like, e.g., the interface trap density and the spacial charge inhomogeneity. To that end, we provide an extensive description of the GIM diode, which leads to an accurate calculation of the sheet Hall coefﬁcient dependent on temperature and gate voltage. The gate dependent inverse sheet Hall coefﬁcient is discussed in detail before we introduce the concept of an equivalent temperature, which is a measure of the spacial charge inhomogeneity. In order to test the concept, we apply it to evaluate already measured Hall data taken from the literature. This evaluation allows us to determine the Drude mobility, even at the charge neutrality point, which is inaccessible with a simple one band Hall mobility analysis, and to shed light on the spacial charge inhomogeneity. The formalism is easily adaptable and provides experimentalists a powerful tool for the characterization of their graphene ﬁeld effect devices.},

            Graphene/hBN heterostructures are promising active materials for devices in the THz domain, such as emitters and photodetectors based on interband transitions. Their performance requires long carrier lifetimes. However, carrier recombination processes in graphene possess sub-picosecond characteristic times for large non-equilibrium carrier densities at high energy. An additional channel has been recently demonstrated in graphene/hBN heterostructures by emission of hBN hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhP) with picosecond decay time. Here, we report on carrier lifetimes in graphene/hBN Zener-Klein transistors of {\textasciitilde}30 ps for photoexcited carriers at low density and energy, using mid-infrared photoconductivity measurements. We further demonstrate the switching of carrier lifetime from {\textasciitilde}30 ps (attributed to interband Auger) down to a few picoseconds upon ignition of HPhP relaxation at finite bias and/or with infrared excitation power. Our study opens interesting perspectives to exploit graphene/hBN heterostructures for THz lasing and highly sensitive THz photodetection as well as for phonon polariton optics.},

In this work, we made simulations of the effect of the three types of losses in piezoelectric materials on the impedance spectrum at the resonance. We analyze independently each type of loss and show the differences among them. On the other hand, electrical and electronic engineers include piezoelectric sensors in electrical circuits to build devices and need electrical models of the sensor element. Frequently, material scientists and engineers use different languages, and the characteristic material coefﬁcients do not have a straightforward translation to those speciﬁc electrical circuit components. To connect both ﬁelds of study, we propose the use of accurate methods of characterization from impedance measurements at electromechanical resonance that lead to determination of all types of losses, as an alternative to current standards. We introduce a simpliﬁed equivalent circuit model with electrical parameters that account for piezoceramic losses needed for the modeling and design of industrial applications.},

	abstract = {The main phenomena and mathematical models of the theory of nonlinear dispersive acoustic waves are described. For the physical dispersion of the relaxation type, the form of the kernels of the integro-differential equation for several relaxation times and the continuous spectrum of such times is indicated. The possibility of obtaining simple equations for media with a finite ‘‘memory time’’ is indicated. As a medium with resonant dispersion, where the kernels have an oscillatory character, a liquid with gas bubbles is considered. The dispersion curves are analyzed. It is argued that the introduction of resonant elements into a homogeneous matrix is a special case of creating metamaterials with unusual nonlinear-dispersion properties. As an example of the geometric dispersion, important problems of nonlinear focusing are considered based on the Ostrovsky–Vakhnenko equation, which is interpreted here as the projection of the Khokhlov–Zabolotskaya equation onto the acoustic beam axis. When analyzing the nonlinear dispersion, it was indicated that in acoustics the dependence of the wave propagation velocity on the magnitude of the perturbation is a common phenomenon. It leads to a distortion of the wave profile in time, as well as to a deformation of the spatial shape of the beam — to effects like self-refraction. In acoustics, nonlinearities of odd degrees are encountered much less frequently than in optics; cubic nonlinearity is possessed, for example, by shear waves in solids. Nevertheless, it leads to original effects — the formation of trapezoidal sawtooth waves and unusual self-focusing. The article systematically presents both known and new results.},

However, due to the relatively weak adhesion of hBN, assembling vdW heterostructures based on hBN has been limited. We report a new dry transfer technique. We used two vdW semiconductors (ZnPS3 and CrPS4) to pick up and encapsulate layers for vdW heterostructures, which otherwise are known to be hard to fabricate. By combining with optimized polycaprolactone (PCL) providing strong adhesion, we demonstrated various vertical heterostructure devices, including quasi-2D superconducting NbSe2 Josephson junctions with atomically clean interface.

            Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) and graphene compose a new family of crystalline materials with atomic thicknesses and exotic mechanical, electronic, and optical properties. Due to their inherent exceptional mechanical flexibility and strength, these 2D materials provide an ideal platform for strain engineering, enabling versatile modulation and significant enhancement of their optical properties. For instance, recent theoretical and experimental investigations have demonstrated flexible control over their electronic states via application of external strains, such as uniaxial strain and biaxial strain. Meanwhile, many nondestructive optical measurement methods, typically including absorption, reflectance, photoluminescence, and Raman spectroscopies, can be readily exploited to quantitatively determine strain-engineered optical properties. This review begins with an introduction to the macroscopic theory of crystal elasticity and microscopic effective low-energy Hamiltonians coupled with strain fields, and then summarizes recent advances in strain-induced optical responses of 2D TMDCs and graphene, followed by the strain engineering techniques. It concludes with exciting applications associated with strained 2D materials, discussions on existing open questions, and an outlook on this intriguing emerging field.},

Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals no moiré pattern on the artiﬁcial bilayer graphene, and tunneling spectroscopy as a function of gate voltage reveals a constant density of states, also in agreement with Bernal stacking. In addition, electron transport probed in dual-gated samples reveals a band gap opening as a function of transverse electric ﬁeld. To illustrate the applicability of this technique to realize vdW heterostructuctures in which the functionality is critically dependent on rotational alignment, we demonstrate resonant tunneling double bilayer graphene heterostructures separated by hexagonal boron-nitride dielectric.},

	abstract = {The integer and fractional quantum Hall effect is investigated using the acoustoelectric effect in a high mobility two-dimensional electron system. This effect is a result of the interaction of the coherent field of an ultrasonic surface acoustic wave and the completely quantized electron system in strong magnetic fields. The mutual interaction leads to both energy and momentum transfer of the wave to the electrons and is reflected in giant quantum oscillations in the sound-induced currents and voltages in the two-dimensional system. Unlike standard magnetotransport experiments the acoustoelectric effect probes the states of the bulk of the electron system rather than those of the edges and thus is suited to gain insight into the quantum Hall effect from a different point of view.},

	abstract = {Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have been considered as promising candidates to fabricate ultimately scaled ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs), due to the atomically thin thickness and high carrier mobility. However, the performance of FETs based on 2D semiconductors has been limited by extrinsic factors, including high contact resistance, strong interfacial scattering, and unintentional doping. Among these challenges, contact resistance is a dominant issue, and important progress has been made in recent years. In this review, the Schottky–Mott model is introduced to show the ideal Schottky barrier, and we further discuss the contribution of the Fermi-level pinning effect to the high contact resistance in 2D semiconductor devices. In 2D FETs, Fermi-level pinning is attributed to the high-energy metal deposition process, which would damage the lattice of atomically thin 2D semiconductors and induce the pinning of the metal Fermi level. Then, two contact structures and the strategies to fabricate low-contact-resistance short-channel 2D FETs are introduced. Finally, our review provides practical guidelines for the realization of high-performance 2D-semiconductors-based FETs with low contact resistance and discusses the outlook of this ﬁeld.},

	abstract = {Thouless pumping provides one of the simplest manifestations of topology in quantum systems and has attracted a lot of recent interest, both theoretically and experimentally. Since the seminal works by David Thouless and Qian Niu in 1983 and 1984, it has been argued that the quantization of the pumped charge is robust against weak disorder, but a clear characterization of the localization properties of the relevant states, and the breakdown of quantized transport in the presence of interaction or out of the adiabatic approximation, has long been debated. Thouless pumping is also the first example of a topological phase emerging in a periodically driven system. Driven systems can exhibit exotic topological phases without any static analogue and have been the subject of many recent proposals both in fermionic and in bosonic systems. Recent experimental studies have been performed in diverse platforms ranging from cold atoms to photonics and condensed-matter systems. This Review serves as a basis to understand the robustness of the topology of slowly driven systems and also highlights the rich properties of topological pumps and their diverse range of applications. Examples include systems with synthetic dimensions or work towards understanding higher-order topological phases, which underline the relevance of topological pumping for the fast-growing field of topological quantum matter.},

We demonstrate that neutral interlayer excitons can propagate across the entire sample and that their propagation can be controlled by excitation power and gate electrodes. We also use devices with ohmic contacts to facilitate the drift motion of charged interlayer excitons. The electrical generation and control of excitons provide a route for achieving quantum manipulation of bosonic composite particles with complete electrical tunability.},

One of the most promising platforms for these devices is excitonic devices, as they offer very efficient coupling to light. Of especial importance are those based on indirect excitons because of their long lifetime. Here, we demonstrate excitonic transistor and router based on bilayer WSe2. Because of their strong dipole moment, excitons in bilayer WSe2 can be controlled by transverse electric field. At the same time, unlike indirect excitons in artificially stacked heterostructures based on transition metal dichalcogenides, naturally stacked bilayers are much simpler in fabrication.},

The advent of 2D materials has provided unprecedented opportunities for novel heterostructures in the form of van der Waals stacks, laterally stitched 2D layers and more complex layered and 3D architectures. This Primer provides an overview of state-of-the-art methodologies for producing such van der Waals heterostructures, focusing on the two fundamentally different strategies, top-down deterministic assembly and bottom-up synthesis. Successful techniques, advantages and limitations are discussed for both approaches. As important as the fabrication itself is the characterization of the resulting engineered materials, for which a range of analysis techniques covering structure, composition and emerging functionality are highlighted. Examples of the properties of artificial van der Waals structures include optoelectronics and plasmonics, twistronics and unique functionality arising from the generalization of van der Waals assembly from 2D to 3D crystalline components. Finally, current issues of reproducibility, limitations and opportunities for future breakthroughs in terms of enhanced homogeneity, interfacial purity, feature control and ultimately orders-of-magnitude increased complexity of van der Waals heterostructures are discussed.},

            Graphene is the first example of truly two‐dimensional crystals – it's just one layer of carbon atoms. It turns out that graphene is a gapless semiconductor with unique electronic properties resulting from the fact that charge carriers in graphene obey linear dispersion relation, thus mimicking massless relativistic particles. This results in the observation of a number of very peculiar electronic properties – from an anomalous quantum Hall effect to the absence of localization. It also provides a bridge between condensed matter physics and quantum electrodynamics and opens new perspectives for carbon‐based electronics. (© 2007 WILEY‐VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

The electrical conductivity is treated with assumptions about the mean free path. It is found to be about 100 times as great parallel to as across crystal planes. A large and anisotropic diamagnetic susceptibility is predicted for the conduction electrons; this is greatest for fields across the layers. The volume optical absorption is accounted for.},

However, the quality of material interfaces often limits the performance of electronic devices made from atomically thick 2D materials and heterostructures. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip-based cleaning is a reliable technique to remove interface contaminants and ﬂatten heterostructures. Here, we demonstrate AFM tipbased cleaning applied to hBN-encapsulated monolayer MoS2 transistors, which results in electrical performance improvements of the devices. To investigate the impact of cleaning on device performance, we compared the characteristics of as-transferred heterostructures and transistors before and after tip-based cleaning using photoluminescence (PL) and electronic measurements. The PL linewidth of monolayer MoS2 decreased from 84 meV before cleaning to 71 meV after cleaning. The extrinsic mobility of monolayer MoS2 ﬁeldeﬀect transistors increased from 21 cm2/Vs before cleaning to 38 cm2/Vs after cleaning. Using the results from AFM topography, photoluminescence, and back-gated ﬁeld-eﬀect measurements, we infer that tip-based cleaning enhances the mobility of hBNencapsulated monolayer MoS2 by reducing interface disorder. Finally, we fabricate a MoS2 ﬁeld-eﬀect transistor (FET) from a tipcleaned heterostructure and achieved a device mobility of 73 cm2/Vs. The results of this work could be used to improve the electrical performance of heterostructure devices and other types of mechanically assembled van der Waals heterostructures.},

	abstract = {Due to the strong in-plane but weak out-of-plane bonding, it is relatively easy to separate nanosheets of two-dimensional (2D) materials from their respective bulk crystals. This exfoliation of 2D materials can yield large 2D nanosheets, hundreds of micrometers wide, that can be as thin as one or a few atomic layers thick. However, the underlying physical mechanisms unique to each exfoliation technique can produce a wide distribution of defects, yields, functionalization, lateral sizes, and thicknesses, which can be appropriate for specific end applications. The five most commonly used exfoliation techniques include micromechanical cleavage, ultrasonication, shear exfoliation, ball milling, and electrochemical exfoliation. In this review, we present an overview of the field of 2D material exfoliation and the underlying physical mechanisms with emphasis on progress over the last decade. The beneficial characteristics and shortcomings of each exfoliation process are discussed in the context of their functional properties to guide the selection of the best technique for a given application. Furthermore, an analysis of standard applications of exfoliated 2D nanosheets is presented including their use in energy storage, electronics, lubrication, composite, and structural applications. By providing detailed insight into the underlying exfoliation mechanisms along with the advantages and disadvantages of each technique, this review intends to guide the reader toward the appropriate batch-scale exfoliation techniques for a wide variety of industrial applications.},

	abstract = {Graphene has emerged as a material with a vast variety of applications. The electronic, optical and mechanical properties of graphene are strongly inﬂuenced by the number of layers present in a sample. As a result, the dimensional characterization of graphene ﬁlms is crucial, especially with the continued development of new synthesis methods and applications. A number of techniques exist to determine the thickness of graphene ﬁlms including optical contrast, Raman scattering and scanning probe microscopy techniques. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), in particular, is used extensively since it provides three-dimensional images that enable the measurement of the lateral dimensions of graphene ﬁlms as well as the thickness, and by extension the number of layers present. However, in the literature AFM has proven to be inaccurate with a wide range of measured values for single layer graphene thickness reported (between 0.4 and 1.7 nm). This discrepancy has been attributed to tip-surface interactions, image feedback settings and surface chemistry. In this work, we use standard and carbon nanotube modiﬁed AFM probes and a relatively new AFM imaging mode known as PeakForce tapping mode to establish a protocol that will allow users to accurately determine the thickness of graphene ﬁlms. In particular, the error in measuring the ﬁrst layer is reduced from 0.1–1.3 nm to 0.1–0.3 nm. Furthermore, in the process we establish that the graphene-substrate adsorbate layer and imaging force, in particular the pressure the tip exerts on the surface, are crucial components in the accurate measurement of graphene using AFM. These ﬁndings can be applied to other 2D materials.},

	abstract = {Thouless pumping provides one of the simplest manifestations of topology in quantum systems, and has attracted a lot of recent interest, both theoretically and experimentally. Since the seminal works by Thouless and Niu in 1983 and 1984, it is argued that the quantization of the pumped charge is robust against weak disorder, but a clear characterization of the localization properties of the relevant states, and the breakdown of quantized transport in the presence of interaction or out of the adiabatic approximation, has been long debated. Thouless pumping is also the first example of a topological phase emerging in a periodically-driven system. Driven systems can exhibit exotic topological phases without any static analogue and have been the subject of many recent proposals both in fermionic and bosonic systems in diverse platforms ranging from cold atoms to photonics and condensed matter systems. In this respect, this review has a twofold purpose: On the one hand, it serves as a basis to understand the robustness of the topology of slowly-driven systems per se; On the other hand, it highlights the rich properties of topological pumps and their diverse range of applications, for instance, in systems with synthetic dimensions or for understanding higher-order topological phases. These examples underline the relevance of topological pumping for the fast growing field of topological quantum matter.},

	abstract = {We propose a method to dynamically generate and control the flow of spin-entangled electrons, each belonging to a spin singlet, by means of adiabatic quantum pumping. The pumping cycle functions by periodic time variation of localized two-body interactions. We develop a generalized approach to adiabatic quantum pumping as traditional methods based on a scattering matrix in one dimension cannot be applied here. We specifically compute the flow of spin-entangled electrons within a Hubbard-like model of quantum dots, discuss possible implementations, and identify parameters that can be used to control the singlet flow.},
